\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Underground cable fault detection is a critical task in power and communication
systems due to the difficulty of accessing buried cables. Traditional fault
detection methods are time-consuming, costly, and often require extensive
manual inspection. This project presents a low-cost cable fault detection system
based on the principle of Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR).

In the proposed system, a short-duration electrical pulse generated using an
NE555 timer is injected into the cable. Reflections caused by impedance
discontinuities are analyzed to determine the location of faults. Signal
conditioning is performed using a Schmitt trigger and an LM358 operational
amplifier. A NodeMCU microcontroller processes the reflected signal and displays
the fault distance on an OLED display. The system is suitable for cable lengths
up to 100 meters and is ideal for academic and small-scale industrial
applications.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}
Cables are widely used in modern power distribution and communication networks due to their improved safety, reduced exposure to environmental conditions, and minimal impact on surrounding infrastructure. However, locating faults in cable systems remains a major challenge, as physical inspection along the entire length is often impractical. Faults such as insulation degradation, conductor damage, or moisture penetration can lead to service interruptions, safety concerns, and increased maintenance expenses.  
Conventional fault detection techniques typically involve manual inspection, excavation, or the use of bulky and expensive testing equipment. These approaches are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and inefficient, particularly for long cable runs. To overcome these limitations, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) provides an effective solution. TDR operates by transmitting a short-duration electrical pulse through the cable and analyzing the reflected signals caused by impedance discontinuities. The location of the fault is determined by measuring the time delay between the transmitted and reflected pulses.  
In the proposed system, a NE555 timer is used to generate a short-duration pulse suitable for TDR-based measurements. The reflected signal is conditioned and compared using an LM358 operational amplifier, enabling clear detection of fault-related reflections. This approach allows local monitoring of cable conditions, reduces the need for manual intervention, and significantly shortens the time required to identify and address faults.  
The objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective and efficient cable fault detection system based on the TDR principle, designed to be simple, reliable, and practical for medium-range applications of up to 100 meters. The system ensures faster fault identification, reduced downtime, and improved reliability of cable networks.

\section{Problem Statement}
Detecting faults in cables is challenging due to their hidden nature, making traditional inspection methods slow, costly, and inefficient. In Nepal, manual detection leads to delays, service disruption, and unnecessary digging. There is a need for a lowcost, accurate solution.

\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}

\section{Related Works}
Cable fault detection is crucial in maintaining reliable electrical distribution
systems. Traditional fault detection techniques often require manual inspection,
which is time-consuming and inefficient. To overcome these limitations, recent
research has focused on advanced techniques such as Time Domain Reflectometry
(TDR) and signal-based analysis methods to improve detection accuracy and
automation.

Gustavsen \textit{et al.} (2010) explored high-frequency modeling of power cables
and established the effectiveness of TDR for locating faults. Their work
demonstrated how impedance mismatches within cables generate signal reflections,
allowing accurate fault detection through waveform analysis.

Simoes \textit{et al.} (2004) emphasized the importance of intelligent monitoring
techniques in power electronics and distribution systems. Their study highlighted
real-time signal processing, embedded control, and automation as essential
elements for modern diagnostic systems.

Patel and Shah (2021) proposed a pulse-reflection-based fault detection model
using embedded processing techniques. Their system analyzes reflected signals
and displays fault locations locally using measurement instruments. The low-cost
design shows strong potential for scalable implementation.

Sharma \textit{et al.} (2022) developed an advanced cable fault detection system
integrating TDR with signal classification techniques. Their approach improves
fault detection accuracy, reduces response time, and supports automated
diagnostic infrastructure.

Overall, the integration of TDR and embedded signal processing enables accurate
fault diagnostics, early fault identification, and reduced system downtime.

\section{Related Theory}

Underground cable fault detection using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is
fundamentally based on the principle of electromagnetic (EM) pulse propagation
through transmission lines and the analysis of reflected signals caused by
impedance variations. The key theoretical elements underlying this process
include electromagnetic wave behavior, impedance discontinuities, and reflection
patterns.

\subsection{Electromagnetic Pulse Propagation}
When a high-frequency voltage pulse is injected into a cable, it propagates as a
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave along the conductor. The propagation
velocity of this wave depends on the dielectric properties of the cable
insulation. Any damage, moisture intrusion, or insulation degradation alters
these properties, affecting signal propagation. As a result, a portion of the
signal is reflected at the fault location, indicating both the presence and
nature of the fault.

\subsection{Impedance Sensing and Fault Location}
The location of a fault is determined by measuring the time interval between the
transmitted pulse and the reflected signal. This round-trip travel time, combined
with the known propagation velocity of the cable, enables accurate calculation of
the distance to the fault. Precise timing measurements and accurate knowledge of
cable material characteristics are essential for reliable fault localization.

Shankar Ramharack and Sanjay Bahadoorsingh (2023) reviewed underground cable fault
detection techniques using TDR and frequency-domain methods. Their study
demonstrated the application of step-pulse TDR combined with wavelet transforms
and matched filters for accurate fault localization without requiring detailed
cable parameters, making the approach suitable for complex or undocumented cablenetworks.

Dr. Klaus Giese (2016) discussed the degradation of electromagnetic pulses in
underground cables due to resistive and dielectric losses. As the pulse
propagates, its amplitude decreases due to attenuation and its waveform spreads
due to dispersion, which complicates the interpretation of reflected signals
during fault analysis.

Dr. Barry M. Novac (2011) emphasized that the characteristic impedance of a
transmission line is a critical parameter in TDR-based systems. Uniform impedance ensures stable wave propagation, while faults or material inconsistencies cause impedance mismatches that generate reflected signals.

\end{figure}

\section{System Development}
The pulse generation subsystem forms the core of the proposed Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) system. An NE555 timer IC is configured in \textbf{monostable mode} to generate short-duration electrical pulses in the microsecond range, which are practical and stable for laboratory-scale TDR applications.  

The pulse width is controlled using a resistor–capacitor network consisting of a 470~$\Omega$ resistor (R1) and a 100~pF capacitor (C1), producing a narrow and repeatable test pulse. This pulse serves as the excitation signal that is injected into the RG-58 coaxial cable under test through a properly terminated BNC connector.  

To improve signal quality, the generated pulse is passed through a 74HC14 Schmitt trigger, which reshapes the waveform by removing noise and slow signal transitions. This ensures sharp rising and falling edges before the pulse enters the cable, thereby enhancing reflection clarity and measurement accuracy.  

When the injected pulse encounters an impedance discontinuity caused by a fault, a portion of the signal is reflected back toward the source. The fault detection mechanism identifies two primary fault conditions:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item \textbf{Open-circuit faults}: High impedance faults generating positive reflections.
    \item \textbf{Short-circuit faults}: Low impedance faults generating negative reflections.
\end{itemize}

The reflected signals are typically weak and susceptible to noise, requiring proper signal conditioning before analysis. The signal processing unit employs an LM358 operational amplifier configured with a voltage gain of approximately 11, achieved using a 1~k$\Omega$ resistor (R2) and a 10~k$\Omega$ resistor (R3). This stage amplifies the reflected pulse while suppressing noise and minimizing the influence of the initial transmitted pulse.  

The conditioned signal is then observed using standard measurement instruments such as an oscilloscope, allowing accurate determination of the time delay between the transmitted and reflected pulses.  

\section{Fault Distance Calculation}
The fault distance is calculated using the standard TDR equation:
\begin{equation}
\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Propagation Velocity}}{2}
\end{equation}

where the propagation velocity of the RG-58 coaxial cable is approximately $2 \times 10^8$~m/s. This method enables reliable fault localization with an accuracy suitable for short- to medium-length cable testing.  

The overall system provides a simple, cost-effective, and reliable approach for cable fault detection without the need for wireless communication or IoT-based processing.
